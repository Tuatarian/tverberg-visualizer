Draws 3r points in the plane and highlights the tverberg depth regions between them. Press r to generate a random configuration on the same number of points, right arrow to increase the number by 3, and left arrow to decrease by 3. Click and drag points with the mouse to move them around. Degenerate tverberg regions (where one of the parts in the partition is not a triangle) are not considered by the program).
